# Daily_Planner

## Description 

This project is a daily work planner that can store an agenda for a single day. I made this project to use jquery and make an app that used some of the functions of jquery. This planner is interactive and changes color through the day to let you know exactly where you are in the day and also what events you have left.

## Installation 

This app is already set to go there is no further installation required. 

## Usage

This app is incredibly simple and easy to use. When you want to keep track of an even, type it into the hour slot for wherever it is and press save. From then it will stay saved to your computer so you wont forget. As you go through the day the information will update with time making sure you don't miss any of your events for that day.
